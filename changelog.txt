- Added capability to use init.d if not using SuperSU, but this is not officially supported. It might make the app work on more firmwares, but it should be noted that init.d behavior differs between firmwares, and unlike su.d provided by SuperSU, no guarantees are made as to the state of the /data partition or SELinux policies when init.d scripts execute. Therefor it is impossible to officially support - it might work, it might not, and this will differ between firmwares.
