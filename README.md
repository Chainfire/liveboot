## About

*LiveBoot* is an app for rooted devices that shows the logcat and
dmesg output on-screen during boot. It has been around since
2014, (then) supporting Android 4.x (or 2011 and Android 2.x if you
include its predecessors).

### Opening the source

It does some neat tricks, others could learn from it. It's not really
in active development anymore (and hasn't been for years), but now and
then people nag me to fix it when it breaks, and sometimes I do. Now
*you* can fix it too! A little joy as 2020 finally ends!

### Open source but in-app puchases?

Yes, please still buy it. Or press the *Freeload* button that has been
in most of my apps for many years that gives you all the features for
free. Or recompile it yourself so it does that.

### Download

You can grab actual releases from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.liveboot)
or in the [XDA thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/LiveBoot.2976189/).

### Feedback

It puts it in the [XDA thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/LiveBoot.2976189/).

### Disclaimer

This hasn't been in active development for a while, and contains code
that has been copy/pasted and passed around throughout my projects
for many years. It wouldn't surprise me if there's code in here
somewhere that was already smelly back in 2011. This is not a
shining example of how to build apps in 2020.

Especially if you're primarily familiar with newer devices, there
may be some weird constructs with regards to root, but keep in mind
this app should still be working on Android's as old as 5.0, and
supporting several different root solutions and versions.

I did not go through the code to clean it up before dumping it here.
Comments could be outdated or just plain wrong.

If it breaks, you get to keep all the pieces.

### Dependencies

Primarily depends on [libRootJava](https://github.com/Chainfire/librootjava)
and [libCFSurface](https://github.com/Chainfire/libcfsurface).

### Enjoy!
Or not.
